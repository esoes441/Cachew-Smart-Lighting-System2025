CachewLight / Smart Lighting System

This project is developed around an intelligent lighting system. 
The system can adjust the lighting automatically or manually by using real-time sensor data. 
When motion is detected by the motion sensors, the lights turn on automatically; 
the LDR sensors optimize brightness according to the ambient light, ensuring energy efficiency. 
Users can easily control the system remotely via a mobile application, 
select predefined lighting modes, or create their own custom modes.

Technologies Used:

Arduino

C/C++

Python

Flask API

React Native

Sensors (LDR, PIR, ESP32)

This project was carried out by a team of six people. I am one of the contributors.
